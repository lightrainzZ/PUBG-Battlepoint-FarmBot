Don´t ask any question if you don´t follow this Instructions.

1-Install python with pip installed, if you have already installed python and you don´t have pip, download this https://goo.gl/cKvcVZ and run it with python (shift + rightclick in the folder and open a CMD here and use =  python get-pip.py)

2- After the first step use this in the same folder:
		pip install pyautogui

		pip install psutil

		pip install Pillow

		pip install pyqt5


3-Now you will have installed python and pip with the needed modules,
so lets put your coords (unless you use 1920x1080 (already there)), for that go here https://pastebin.com/DHBQB0XU
create a python file (make sure to have the option to see the extension of the file) 
so just a file with the name that you want with that code but with .py not .txt

4- As it says the step 3 if you use 1080 just leave it like that if not, 
you have to put the coords in the first line of the reconnect button,
in the second line the coords of the button to leave to lobby when you die (right botton corner),
and in the thirth line the coords of the reconnect to the servers are busy msg. It has to be like that (with your cords ofc)

Make sure you change your montior resolution to match whatever resolution you pick in the bot, otherwise it wont work correctly.


Turn off any color corrections like reshade before using the bot otherwise it will not work. 

Directions: 

Make sure the game isnt open.

1.Open the bot (it takes a few seconds to load)
2. Choose your resolution 
3. hit start
4. The bot will open the game. Wait for the game to load and the bot wiill auto start working. (Dont worry if the bot ui freezes up, thats normal. )

MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING FULLSCREEN WINDOWED WITH RESHADE TURNED OFF

If you run into any errors, find the bot not working correctly, or not running: 

* Check the help tab in the bot
* if the bot is crashing, open cmd or powershell first, then run python botgui.py and let me know what error you got 

TURN OFF WALLPAPER ENGINE:

it conflicts with this bot and will cause it to not work correctly

This bot will: 

* auto jump at a random point on the plane.

* auto hold down the space bar just in case you land in water and end up underwater 

* It will also lay down after running and jumping. 

* I added a few more configs to the bot so it supports 2560x 1440p and 2560 x1080p. I dont have the last resolution so it might not work well for 2560 x 1080p.

* Create a file that tells you the Bps that you have won (It couldn´t be exact)

* Leave all the buttons (die(JUST WAIT BEFORE FLAME), reconnect, and servers busy)

* Can work with an empty input.txt ofc, it wont click that xD


Future changes:

*Make sure that the bor reopen the GAME

*"Laptop mode", to turn the bot off for 30m (with the game too ofc) (in april I should have it)

*Tell me more <3
