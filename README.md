# Features
* auto jump at a random point on the plane.
* auto hold down the space bar just in case you land in water and end up underwater 
* It will also lay down after running and jumping. 
* I added a few more configs to the bot so it supports 2560x 1440p and 2560 x1080p. I dont have the last resolution so it might not work well for 2560 x 1080p.
* Create a file that tells you the Bps that you have won (It couldn´t be exact)
* Leave all the buttons (die(JUST WAIT BEFORE FLAME), reconnect, and servers busy)
* Leaves match a few minutes after it starts ands finds a new match
* Around 6k per 8 hours without you having to do anything ( 42k bp a week @ 8 hours a day, all the crates + sell them on steam)
* Safe, no has been banned for AFK farming
